            <!-- India climate info goes here -->
            India’s climate consists of a variety depending on the location.
            Generally, India has a hot, tropical climate while the northern
            region is cooler. Summer has very hot temperatures, reaching to a
            maximum of 45°C (113°F), while winters are cool and dry. Monsoons
            are frequent during the summer, sometimes causing flooding along
            rivers. Himalayan mountains in the north prevent cold winds from
            coming into India, protecting the country from cold winters. The
            mountain range also traps monsoon winds from leaving the country.
            The monsoon winds are frequent during the monsoon season, which is
            one among the five seasons of India: summer, monsoon, autumn,
            winter, and spring.

        <h2>Overpopulation of India</h2>

      <div class="modal-body">

            <!-- Overpopulation of India info goes here -->
            India’s population is a whopping 1.2 billion and is expected to rise
            to 1.8 billion at around 2050. Overpopulation adversely affects the
            country’s health issues as water and air pollution levels continue
            to rise because of crowdedness. Infrastructure is struggling to keep
            up as less and less services are made available for India’s
            citizens. This includes transportation, healthcare, education, and
            housing. Overconsumption is a prime byproduct of overpopulation, and
            this puts natural resources, food, and drinking water at risk to
            being rapidly depleted. Land for food are being over-exploited, and
            ground pollution levels will also severely increase. The country’s
            overpopulation also brings with it economic inequality and
            unemployment since there are not enough jobs to handle the
            unrestricted population growth rate.
